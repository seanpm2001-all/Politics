# Articles 11 and 13

Looking back now, I am not entirely sure why I hated Article 11 and 13 so much. I am going to need to go and research for a bit.

**...**

Yeah, I was completely justified to be **against articles 11 and 13** it seems to have passed, so I feel bad for Europe. The 2 major problems with this copyright bill were the copyright measures needed, and the link tax. As of April 11th 2021 (about 2 years later) it is still completely impossible to create a copyright filter good enough to meet even 1% of the needs of this bill. Copyright should just be abolished, and these laws shouldn't be made. These one should have just stayed a draft.
