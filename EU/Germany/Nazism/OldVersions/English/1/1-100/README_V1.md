# Nazism

I am completely against Nazism. It is a heavily flawed ideology that has killed millions of innocent people. I will fight hard to make sure history doesn't repeat itself. The jews that died were innocent, the Nazis aren't. It is common sense.

## Holocaust

The Holocaust is an event that is so tragic that no matter how many times I read about it, I still have the same level of negativity towards Nazi Germany, and the same amount of all the possible bad feelings. I don't think it is something I will ever get used to. It was so tragic, and so pointless. It really set the world back pretty far.
