# Communism

I am currently not very supportive of Communism, as I haven't seen any Communist countries live up to what the Communist Manifesto proposed. Unregulated Capitalism in my opinion (and factually) is heavily flawed, and has caused many problems in the world that we still see today (such as Google, Nestl√©, and many others)
