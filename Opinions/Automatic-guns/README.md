# Automatic/Semi-Automatic weapons

The AR-15 and other semi-automatic and automatic firearms NEED TO BE BANNED from public usage. There is no ethical reason why you would need so many bullets other than to mass murder innocent people, which is not ethical at all. Hunting with an AR-15 would result in significant overkill on everything, and the weapon is too common in mass shootings, especially school shootings
