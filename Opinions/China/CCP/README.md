# Chinese Communist Party problems

China needs to be dealt with. Their government seems worse than the USSR. It is like full-on 1984 there. They seem to have used 1984 as a guide book, and made even more changes.

There is no freedom of speech there, just censorship. Also, millions of Uyghur Muslims are in concentration camps there. Concentration camps should NOT be tolerated. We should treat them like Nazi Germany and do something to stop them. Protest in any way you can.
