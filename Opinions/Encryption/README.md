# Encryption

## Encryption should not be illegal

Outlawing encryption will only result in new forms of encryption being made, and a period of suffering, as our entire tech architecture (the ones who comply immediately) is completely destroyed. Just stop spying on your citizens, you shouldn't have to try to destroy everything just so you can monitor people.
