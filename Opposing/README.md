Political come out (Saturday, January 30th 2021)

I have been hiding my politics for a while. Seeing how many of the beliefs I have have been already made public, I have decided to come out further, as I don't want to be labeled incorrectly.

I am an independant that leans towards democratic socialism. I in no way lean conservative or to the Republican party. I have no plans in becoming a politician in office
I support socialism, but live in late-stage capitalism, and I hate many aspects of it.

I will keep my political beliefs inside of this repository and not let it spill out, unless absolutely necessary. If you see political bias in another one of my projects, please report it.

Please use common sense. Don't gain prejudice and hate on people due to political beliefs. Avoid a "us vs. Them" situation. I plan on going no further with politics.
