# US Politics

In US politics, I lean towards the Democratic Party, but have not decided to become a democrat (I decided to stay an independant) however I am highly against the modern Republican Party (since at least the 1960s) my 2 most hated American presidents are Andrew Jackson and Donald Trump.
